# Bricklink parts lists

This repository contains parts lists of LEGO models we build by instructions of different books we own. 

The format of the parts lists is **BrickLink XML**.

Details on the format and how to create **Wanted List** can be found in the ["bricklink - Help Center"](https://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=207)

The repository will not include any instructions.
Please buy the book, if you want to build them.
